# questions-template

A template to help you make something like https://questions.wizardzines.com.
You can see it in action at https://questions-template.github.io.

The CSS is currently a mess, but hopefully it's a helpful starting point.

### maintenance

I don't know how likely I am to keep maintaining this actively. I'd love PRs
that clean up the CSS/JS, but am probably less likely to merge PRs that add new
features. 

### let me know what you build!

If you end up using this for something, I'd love to know what you make -- my email address is julia@jvns.ca.

### license

Everything in this repository is MIT licensed.
